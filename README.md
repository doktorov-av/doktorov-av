    - for educational purposes, simple algorithms
- **C++**
    - solving leetcode problems
    - DirectX11 & WinAPI based game engine
    - game logic within Unreal Engine 5 (along with blueprints)

- **Lua**
    - redis scripts execution with EVAL
    - made scenarious in custom maps for Company of Heroes 2
- **Go**
    - RESTful API's
    - alarm protocols for NIKIET company
- **Python**
    - machine learning basics (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- **Java**
    - tried to develop minecraft modes with forge, found it a difficult language (probably not a language but forge itself, but still...)
    - would like to dive deeper into Java
- **TypeScript**
    - writing next.js pages with react framework
- **Bash**
    - build automatization scripts, systemd services, debian postinst, prerm

### Tools

I've worked with many tools for developing, debugging, testing and deploying applications.

**Great level**:
* **CMake**:  Configration of C++ projects, finding dependencies, installing libraries, custom targets
* C++ compilers: **GCC, Clang, MSVC**
* Package managers: **Conan (v2), vcpkg**
* C++ testing frameworks: **Gtest, Boost.Test**
* C++ libraries: **stl** (from C++11 to C++23), **boost** (asio, mp11, property_tree, program_options), **spdlog, drogon, pqxx** and etc...
* **Docker**: .dockerfile images, docker compose, docker registries, commit, exec, entrypoints and etc
* **Git** (CLI or JetBrains GUI): providing reasonable commit messages, frequent commits, deviding worktree into separate changelists
* **React**: class components, function components, hooks, state & props, page render flow
* API & Webhooks testing tools: **Postman**, **Insomnia**, **CloudPub**

**Intermediate level**:
* **PostgreSQL**: functions, creation of tables and types, column references, joins, migrating, load/save dump, libraries like pqxx (C++), sqlx, squirrel (Go)
* **Redis**: storing, fetching cached data (redigo)
* **Next.js**: app router, pages metadata, server and client components

**Basic level**:
* **Linux CLI**: find, whereis, grep, ip, netstat, etc...
* **JS package managers**: npm, yarn, pnpm

This list can continue much longer, but other tools won't be mentioned here for sake of readability.

### Hobbies

- **_Coding_**, especially love researching new tools that makes developing live easier as well as developing them </br>
- **_Working out_**, lifting heavy weights with friends is one of my favourite </br>
- **_Gaming_**, Minecraft, Heartstone, Subnautica, Company of Heroes 2, etc... </br>
- **_Motorbiker_**, nearest future plans... </br>
